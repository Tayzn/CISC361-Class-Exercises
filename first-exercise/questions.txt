1. 
Single-threaded version averages between 0.187 - 0.203 seconds to run

2. 
Multi-threaded version averages between 0.156 - 0.187 seconds to run

3. 
On average, the multi-threaded program runs faster, as expected.

4/5. 
Using more than 2 threads doesn't seem to make the program any faster. It actually appears to have heightened the average.
As I make the number of elements lower, the timings seem to converge and the single-threaded approach is sometimes even faster.
I assume these observations can be explained by the added resource cost of creating additional threads.
